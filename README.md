# About Techn0man1ac's project

Hello, my name is Sergey Trush. I am a computer systems engineer (my resume can be found [here](https://github.com/techn0man1ac/about/tree/main/MyResume "Link to my resume in 3 languages, in two formats, pdf and docx")).

It turns out that I like to create technologies, "ride" on the crest of a wave of technologies, and you are on a page about my project on the network, called ["Techn0man1ac"](https://www.google.com/search?q=Techn0man1ac "google search page")(tekhnomaniak) or Tech01(short).

## My links on social networks:
In many platforms, I tried to create a page, a kind of canvas of technology, technique and creativity. Here are the links to the most popular (in my opinion) social networks:

# Why "Techn0man1ac"???(tekhnomaniak)

![Techn0man1ac logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techn0man1ac/about/main/Img/Techn0man1ac%20logo.jpg)

I spent a lot of time thinking about what to call what I am by nature. I tried different nicknames and names, but I had to come to one word, or letter combination, preferably in the Latin alphabet, since my project involves going beyond the CIS countries.

Since childhood I have been fond of contemplation, well, if you can call it that. I disassembled everything that I could understand at home, looked at how it was arranged, tried to understand how it works ... And now, years later I managed to carry this contemplation of the technological sphere of the Earth (or technium in other words).

The meaning that I put into the nickname "Technomaniac" is in two words "technology" and "mania" - a hobby, but almost everywhere I planned to settle, Facebook, YouTube and other other social networks, the nickname "Technoman" was busy, then I tried the classic trick - to replace the letter "o" with the number "0", but everything was also busy, so I came to Techn0man1ac, and 0s and 1s mean digital space.

# Why I do it all? 

I asked myself this many times, tried to leave, delete profiles on social networks, but I still come back.
Only recently, I realized that my project should have a mission, otherwise I am simply scattered, and I have decided on the mission - the global enlightenment of society under a technological wrapper. To be honest, the source of inspiration was Eckhart Tolle's book. "New land".

That’s why I’m investing tons of time, terabytes of data.
